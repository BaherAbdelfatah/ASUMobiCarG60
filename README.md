Smart Toy Project

Overview

MobiCar is a next generation of children toys. It allows complete mobile control over cars using
bluetooth signal. MobiCar is equipped with mini computer, sensors and actuators in additional to
reliable mechanical system and attractive frame. This combination offers hundreds of applications to
children. They can play, study, program and
innovate. Children can make basic movements
using their mobile. They can write a program their
car to follow a line drawn on the floor. MobiCar
can follow light source, avoid obstacles, recognise
objects, obey voice commands, dance with music,
move in fixed or custom shapes and more.

MobiCar Hardware

MobiCar hardware is equipped with arduino controller to make it
easier for programming. The communication is provided via
bluetooth module. The USB port is used for battery charging and
programming. The driving motor is controlled by H-Bridge
module to control the velocity. The steering mechanism is
controlled by a servo module. Optionally the car may equipped
with following pluggable sensors: two light sensors at front for light follow up application. Two color
detector at bottom for line tracking application. Front camera for video streaming, image capturing and
object recognition applications. Mic for voice command application. Proximity sensor at front for
obstacle avoidance application. Finally, there is a speaker and leds.

MobiCar Software

MobiCar provided with a set of mobile applications to submit basic control,
issue and replay a sequence of commands, program car actions using blockly
language, move the car in a fixed or custom paths, move the car in augmented
reality environment. Students can program their cars from computer using
arduino development environment.
